important information  in this owner’s manual, you will find the  text under the heading “warning” and  “note” which highlights important infor­ mation. pay particular attention to these  highlighted messages.noteindicates additional information that will  assist you in gaining the optimum ben­ efit and care for your vehicle.warningindicates procedures or information that  must be followed precisely in order to  avoid the possibility of severe personal  injury and serious damage to the vehi­ cle.safe driving   safety consciousness not only ensures  your safety and the safety of other road  users, but it also helps to reduce the wear  and tear on your vehicle.  safe driving depends on:how quickly you make decisions to  avoid an accident.  your ability to concentrate.how well you can see and judge ob­ jects.how well familiar you are with your ve­ hicle controls and its capabilities.notefatigue is a result of physical or mental  exertion that impairs judgment. driver  fatigue may be due to inadequate  sleep, extended work hours, strenuous  work or non-work activities or combina­ tion of other factors. take rest at regular  intervals.safety tipsalways take into account the road con­ ditions, weather conditions, vehicle  speed in order to prevent accidents.turn ‘on’ the side indicators at least  30 meters before taking a turn or  changing the lane.decelerate to a safe speed before tak­ ing turn. do not apply brakes during  cornering.when overtaking other vehicles, watch  out for the oncoming vehicle.never drive under the influence of al­ cohol or drugs.if your vehicle is equipped with info­ tainment/navigation system, set and  make changes to your travel route only  when the vehicle is parked.program radio presets with the vehicle  parked, and use your programmed  presets to make radio use quicker and  simpler.

driving through water  do not drive through flooded areas. judge  the depth of water before driving through  it. otherwise, water may enter the vehicle  interior or the engine compartment.  if at all the situation demands that you  have to drive through water then;keep engine in higher rpm and crawl  the vehicle in low gear.flowing or rushing water creates  strong forces. driving through flowing  water could cause the vehicle to about  trying to drive through flowing water.lightly apply the brake pedal to dry the  liners until the brakes work normally  once you are out of water.warningdo not attempt to start the engine if ve­ hicle gets flooded due to water. tow the  vehicle to a safe place. contact a near­ est tata motors authorised service  centre.driving on a rainy daycheck wiper blades, lights and brakes  for proper functioning and condition.check the tyre treads depth, the con­ dition of the tread and tyre.avoid harsh braking and sharp turns. it  may cause loss of control and lead to  a skid.for slowing down, shift to lower gears  • and brake gently.  keep lights ‘on’ if visibility is poor  • driving on wet roads   on wet road or during light showers,  “aquaplaning” can occur. “aquaplaning” is  the loss of direct contact be-tween the  road surface and the vehicle’s tires due to  a water film forming between them. steer­ ing or braking the vehicle can be very dif­ ficult, and loss of control can occur.   there is no hard and fast rule about aqua­ planing. the best advice is to slow down  when the road is wet.noteif you have driven for a long time in  heavy rain without braking, there may  be a delayed reaction from the brakes  when braking for the first time. you have  to press the brake pedal more firmly.  maintain a greater distance from the ve­ hicle in frontnight drivingensure that all lights are working and  windshield, window glasses are clean.drive more slowly at night than in the  daytime, as the visual range is re­ stricted at night. maintain a speed such  that you can stop within illuminated  distance of headlamps.do not use the high beam unless in­ evitable. it may dazzle the driver of the  oncoming vehicle, thus causing an ac­ cident.use headlamp main/dip beam to alert  other road users on turns/ cross roads  etc.  use side indicators for lane change or

turning  driving on gradients  when climbing gradient, the vehicle may  begin to slow down and show a lack of  power. if this happens, shift to a lower gear  and apply power smoothly so that there is  no loss of traction.  when driving down a hill, the engine brak­ ing should be used by shifting into a lower  gear. do not drive in neutral gear or switch  off the engine.warningon long and steep gradients you must  reduce the load on the brakes by shift­ ing early to a lower gear. this allows  you to take ad-vantage of the engine  braking effect and helps avoid over­ heating of service brakes resulting in re­ duced braking efficiencydriving on highway   stopping distance progressively, in- creases with vehicle speed. maintain a  sufficient distance between your vehicle  and the vehicle ahead.   for long distance driving, perform safety  checks before starting a trip and take rest  at certain intervals to prevent fatigueseat belts  this section of user manual describes  your vehicle’s seat belt, airbag and child  restraints system. please read and follow  all these instructions care-fully to minimise  risk of severe injury or death.seat belts are the primary restraints  system in the vehicle. all occupants,  including the driver, should always  wear their seat belts to minimize the  risk of injury.sit back and adjust (if equipped), the  • seat. make sure that your seat is ad­ justed to a good driving position and  the back of the seat is upright.  buckling the shoulder seat beltgrasp the tongue then slowly pull out  the seat belt over the shoulder and  across the chest. when the seat belt is  long enough to fit, insert the tongue  into the lock buckle until you hear a  “click” which indicates that the seat  belt is securely locked.position the lap portion of seat belt  across your pelvic bone, below your

abdomen. to remove slack, pull up a  bit on the shoulder seat belt. to loosen  the lap portion seat belt if it is too tight,  tilt the tongue and pull on the lap seat  belt. a snug seat belt reduces the risk  of sliding under the seat belt in a colli­ sion.  ensure that the seat belt running  over the body (shoulder segment and  lap segment) does not have any twist.  twisted seat belt may not offer effec­ tive protection when required.  releasing the seat belt  to release the seat belt, push the red but­ ton on the lock buckle. the seat belt will  automatically retract to its stowed position.  if necessary, slide the tongue down the  webbing to allow the seat belt to retract  fully.notethe above image is for reference pur­ pose only.fixed rear centre lap seat beltwhen buckling, make sure you hear a  click confirming that the tab is latched  into the seat belt lock. to tighten it, pull  the loose end through the buckle until  the seat belt is comfortably adjusted  around the pelvic bone (hips).seat belt height adjustments (if appli­ cable)   if height adjustment is provided in the seat  belt, occupant can adjust it to their com­ fort, as may be applicable.notethe above image is for reference pur­ pose only.

warningnever use a rearward facing child re­ straint on a seat protected by an active  airbag in front of it, death or serious in­ jury to the child can occur.airbag deployment conditions  when front airbags should not deploy?  minor frontal collision: seat belt (if worn)  offers adequate occupant protection in low  severity collisions. the airbags are trig­ gered only when there is a collision severe  enough to trigger the airbags. deployment  of frontal airbags is not beneficial in low  severity collisions.  side collision: during a side collision, oc­ cupants tend to move sideways. there­ fore, deploying frontal airbags in such  situations will not benefit the occupants.  side airbags and side curtain airbags (if  equipped) are specifically designed to re­ duce the injuries that can occur in side col­ lision.  rear collision: during a rear collision, oc­ cupants tend to move (rearwards) awayfrom frontal airbags. therefore, deploying  frontal airbags in such situations will not  protect the occupant. head restraints and  seat belts provide occupant protection dur­ ing a rear collision.  rollovers collision: during a rollover col­ lision, unbelted occupants may float inside  the passenger compartment. this will in­ crease the risk of injuries and may prove  to be fatal. wearing seat belts provide  highly effective occupant protection during  rollover collision. front airbags, are not de­ signed to deploy in a rollover as frontal  airbags cannot offer any protection in  rollover collision.  when front airbags/side airbags/side  curtain airbags (if equipped) deploy  with minor or no visible vehicle dam­ age?  the airbags are triggered only when there  is a collision severe enough to trigger the  airbags. the extent of vehicle damage is  not always the correct indicator for airbag  deployment. in some extreme/rare condi­ tions; of rough road driving, running into a  curb or hitting other fixed objects; theairbags may deploy depending upon the  severity of collision. in some of these con­ ditions, damage to the vehicle may be  minor or not be readily visible.  when front airbags/side airbags/side  curtain airbags (if equipped) may not  deploy, even with exterior visible vehi­ cle damage?  the airbags are triggered only when there  is a collision severe enough to trigger the  airbags. the amount of visible vehicle  damage is not always the correct indicator  for airbag deployment. some collisions  can result in visible damage but with no  airbag deployment, because the airbags  would not have been needed or would not  have provided protection even if they had  deployed. seat belts, if worn, offer ade­ quate occupant protection in such cases.noteif your car was flooded and has soaked  carpeting or water on the flooring, you  should not try to start the engine; we  recommended that kindly contact tata  motors authorized dealer.

anti-lock braking system  (abs) (if equipped)abs  regulates  brake  pressure in such a way  that the wheels do not  lock when you brake.  this allows you to continue steering the  vehicle when braking.  the abs warning lamp in the instrument  cluster lights up when the ignition is  switched on. it goes off after 2-3 seconds  if system is healthy.warningif abs is faulty, the wheels could  lock when braking. the steer ability  and braking characteristics may be  severely impaired. there is an in­ creased danger of skidding and ac­ cidents.if abs is faulty, the wheels coulddrive on carefully. have abs  checked immediately at the tata  motors authorized service cen­ tre as soon as possible.drive on carefully. have abswhile brakingin case of emergency braking, press  the brake pedal fully. this allows the  abs to regulate braking force and  maintain directional control of vehicle.when abs is active driver may feel  brake pedal pulsating and very low  (abs) motor activation noise from en­ gine compartment which is normal dur­ ing braking.warningabs may not shorten the distance  in all situation.abs may not shorten the distanceabs system will have the effect of  increased stopping distance due to  conditions such as gravel, pot holes,  slippery surfaces, wet road, ground  covered with snow etc.abs system will have the effect oftravelling on bad road, panic brak­ ing brake pedal may become hard,  this is due to abs system taking  control. abs will not compensate for  bad road, weather conditions and  poor driving judgment. always drivetravelling on bad road, panic brak­carefully in adverse weather and  traffic conditions.always keep safe distance and ad­ here to speed limits.

electronic brake force dis­ tribution (ebd)      ebd monitors and controls the  brake pressure on the rear  wheels to improve driving sta­ bility while braking.  ebd provides optimal braking pressure  distribution between front and rear wheels  to optimize braking distance and to ensure  vehicle stability by means of lowering  braking pressure increase at rear wheels.warningif ebd is malfunctioning, the rear  wheels can lock, e.g. under full  braking. this increases the risk of  skidding and an accident.if ebd is malfunctioning, the rearyou should therefore adapt your  driving style to the different handling  characteristics.  have the brake sys­ tem checked immediately at a tata  motors authorized service cen­ tre as soon as possible.you should therefore adapt yourelectronic  stability  pro­ gram (esp) (if equipped)electronic  stability  pro­esp monitors driving sta­ bility and traction.  if esp detects that the ve­ hicle is deviating from the direction desired  by the driver, one or more wheels are  braked to stabilize the vehicle. the engine  output is also modified to keep the vehicle  on the desired course within physical lim­ its. esp assists the driver when pulling  away on wet or slippery roads. esp can  also stabilize the vehicle during braking  and acceleration.additional safety features  (as available)  cornering stability control (csc)  corner stability control supports / stabi­ lizes vehicle during partial braking on  curves by reducing pressure at required  inner wheel of the vehicle.  this helps to reduce probability of vehicle  over steering during cornering.  off road abs  based on wheel speed information off  road abs helps to avoid wheel lock on un­ even surfaces like loose gravel, pot holes  by reducing the stopping distance com­ pared to standard abs.  electronic traction control (etc)  the electronic traction control system  function (etc) is designed as a slip control  system to prevent the driven wheels of a  vehicle from excessive wheel slip.  roll over mitigation (rom)  the main feature of the roll over mitiga­ tion function is the detection of a rollover  critical situation and to prevent the vehicle

rollover. this is done by active brake inter­ ventions on selected wheels, thereby re­ ducing the forces that cause a roll-over  situation.  brake disc wiping (bdw)  water on the brake disc leads to a delay  in brake response time. the purpose of  the function brake disc wiping is to re­ move moisture when driving in wet condi­ tions automatically. to get quick response  form brake and better deceleration.  electronic brake pre-fill (ebp)  the electronic brake prefill (ebp) function  reduces the air gap of the brake pad and  the brake disc. the function is triggered  after a sudden release of the accelerator  pedal due to an unexpected emergency  brake situation. by actively pre-filling the  brake-system the brake response time is  reduced and results in a shorter stopping  distance.  hydraulic brake assist (hba)in a dangerous emergency situation, most  drivers don’t use the full available perform­ ance of the brake system, because theybrake too soft. the hba function detects  the critical situation and builds up addi­ tional brake pressure to reduce the brak­ ing distance.  hydraulic  fading  compensation  (hfc)brake too soft. the hba function detects  the critical situation and builds up addi­ tional brake pressure to reduce the brak­ ing distance.  hydraulic  fading  compensationin dangerous fading situations most driv­ ers operate the brake pedal with a small  or regular braking force and they never  reach to the maximum possible vehicle de­ celeration. the hfc function improve the  stopping distance by eliminating required  pressure build-up lag by the driver.  dynamic wheel torque by brake  (dwt-b)  the main goal of the function is to improve  the agility of a vehicle and to enable a  more direct steering. this is mainly  achieved by braking interventions at the  inner wheels during turning. dwt-b re­ duces understeer tendency of the car and  a higher curve speed can be achieved.engine drag torque control (edtc)  on slippery road conditions during in- gear  braking or shift down of gear or sudden  throttle release on a curve road.  this causes high engine drag on the  driven wheel resulting into brake slip situ­ ations without any brake application.  this makes vehicle highly under steerable.  edtc controls such brake slip on the  driven wheels by increasing the engine  torque to makes the vehicle stable and  steerable.  hill hold control (hhc)  hill hold control is a comfort function. the  main intend is to prevent the vehicle from  rolling backwards while driving off up-hill  on an inclined surface.

important information  in this owner’s manual, you will find the  text under the heading “warning” and  “note” which highlights important infor­ mation. pay particular attention to these  highlighted messages.noteindicates additional information that will  assist you in gaining the optimum ben­ efit and care for your vehicle.warningindicates procedures or information that  must be followed precisely in order to  avoid the possibility of severe personal  injury and serious damage to the vehi­ cle.safe driving   safety consciousness not only ensures  your safety and the safety of other road  users, but it also helps to reduce the wear  and tear on your vehicle.  safe driving depends on:how quickly you make decisions to  avoid an accident.  your ability to concentrate.how well you can see and judge ob­ jects.how well familiar you are with your ve­ hicle controls and its capabilities.notefatigue is a result of physical or mental  exertion that impairs judgment. driver  fatigue may be due to inadequate  sleep, extended work hours, strenuous  work or non-work activities or combina­ tion of other factors. take rest at regular  intervals.safety tipsalways take into account the road con­ ditions, weather conditions, vehicle  speed in order to prevent accidents.turn ‘on’ the side indicators at least  30 meters before taking a turn or  changing the lane.decelerate to a safe speed before tak­ ing turn. do not apply brakes during  cornering.when overtaking other vehicles, watch  out for the oncoming vehicle.never drive under the influence of al­ cohol or drugs.if your vehicle is equipped with info­ tainment/navigation system, set and  make changes to your travel route only  when the vehicle is parked.program radio presets with the vehicle  parked, and use your programmed  presets to make radio use quicker and  simpler.

driving through water  do not drive through flooded areas. judge  the depth of water before driving through  it. otherwise, water may enter the vehicle  interior or the engine compartment.  if at all the situation demands that you  have to drive through water then;keep engine in higher rpm and crawl  the vehicle in low gear.flowing or rushing water creates  strong forces. driving through flowing  water could cause the vehicle to about  trying to drive through flowing water.lightly apply the brake pedal to dry the  liners until the brakes work normally  once you are out of water.warningdo not attempt to start the engine if ve­ hicle gets flooded due to water. tow the  vehicle to a safe place. contact a near­ est tata motors authorised service  centre.driving on a rainy daycheck wiper blades, lights and brakes  for proper functioning and condition.check the tyre treads depth, the con­ dition of the tread and tyre.avoid harsh braking and sharp turns. it  may cause loss of control and lead to  a skid.for slowing down, shift to lower gears  • and brake gently.  keep lights ‘on’ if visibility is poor  • driving on wet roads   on wet road or during light showers,  “aquaplaning” can occur. “aquaplaning” is  the loss of direct contact be-tween the  road surface and the vehicle’s tires due to  a water film forming between them. steer­ ing or braking the vehicle can be very dif­ ficult, and loss of control can occur.   there is no hard and fast rule about aqua­ planing. the best advice is to slow down  when the road is wet.noteif you have driven for a long time in  heavy rain without braking, there may  be a delayed reaction from the brakes  when braking for the first time. you have  to press the brake pedal more firmly.  maintain a greater distance from the ve­ hicle in frontnight drivingensure that all lights are working and  windshield, window glasses are clean.drive more slowly at night than in the  daytime, as the visual range is re­ stricted at night. maintain a speed such  that you can stop within illuminated  distance of headlamps.do not use the high beam unless in­ evitable. it may dazzle the driver of the  oncoming vehicle, thus causing an ac­ cident.use headlamp main/dip beam to alert  other road users on turns/ cross roads  etc.  use side indicators for lane change or

turning  driving on gradients  when climbing gradient, the vehicle may  begin to slow down and show a lack of  power. if this happens, shift to a lower gear  and apply power smoothly so that there is  no loss of traction.  when driving down a hill, the engine brak­ ing should be used by shifting into a lower  gear. do not drive in neutral gear or switch  off the engine.warningon long and steep gradients you must  reduce the load on the brakes by shift­ ing early to a lower gear. this allows  you to take ad-vantage of the engine  braking effect and helps avoid over­ heating of service brakes resulting in re­ duced braking efficiencydriving on highway   stopping distance progressively, in- creases with vehicle speed. maintain a  sufficient distance between your vehicle  and the vehicle ahead.   for long distance driving, perform safety  checks before starting a trip and take rest  at certain intervals to prevent fatigueseat belts  this section of user manual describes  your vehicle’s seat belt, airbag and child  restraints system. please read and follow  all these instructions care-fully to minimise  risk of severe injury or death.seat belts are the primary restraints  system in the vehicle. all occupants,  including the driver, should always  wear their seat belts to minimize the  risk of injury.sit back and adjust (if equipped), the  • seat. make sure that your seat is ad­ justed to a good driving position and  the back of the seat is upright.  buckling the shoulder seat beltgrasp the tongue then slowly pull out  the seat belt over the shoulder and  across the chest. when the seat belt is  long enough to fit, insert the tongue  into the lock buckle until you hear a  “click” which indicates that the seat  belt is securely locked.position the lap portion of seat belt  across your pelvic bone, below your

abdomen. to remove slack, pull up a  bit on the shoulder seat belt. to loosen  the lap portion seat belt if it is too tight,  tilt the tongue and pull on the lap seat  belt. a snug seat belt reduces the risk  of sliding under the seat belt in a colli­ sion.  ensure that the seat belt running  over the body (shoulder segment and  lap segment) does not have any twist.  twisted seat belt may not offer effec­ tive protection when required.  releasing the seat belt  to release the seat belt, push the red but­ ton on the lock buckle. the seat belt will  automatically retract to its stowed position.  if necessary, slide the tongue down the  webbing to allow the seat belt to retract  fully.notethe above image is for reference pur­ pose only.fixed rear centre lap seat beltwhen buckling, make sure you hear a  click confirming that the tab is latched  into the seat belt lock. to tighten it, pull  the loose end through the buckle until  the seat belt is comfortably adjusted  around the pelvic bone (hips).seat belt height adjustments (if appli­ cable)   if height adjustment is provided in the seat  belt, occupant can adjust it to their com­ fort, as may be applicable.notethe above image is for reference pur­ pose only.

anti-lock braking system  (abs) (if equipped)abs  regulates  brake  pressure in such a way  that the wheels do not  lock when you brake.  this allows you to continue steering the  vehicle when braking.  the abs warning lamp in the instrument  cluster lights up when the ignition is  switched on. it goes off after 2-3 seconds  if system is healthy.warningif abs is faulty, the wheels could  lock when braking. the steer ability  and braking characteristics may be  severely impaired. there is an in­ creased danger of skidding and ac­ cidents.if abs is faulty, the wheels coulddrive on carefully. have abs  checked immediately at the tata  motors authorized service cen­ tre as soon as possible.drive on carefully. have abswhile brakingin case of emergency braking, press  the brake pedal fully. this allows the  abs to regulate braking force and  maintain directional control of vehicle.when abs is active driver may feel  brake pedal pulsating and very low  (abs) motor activation noise from en­ gine compartment which is normal dur­ ing braking.warningabs may not shorten the distance  in all situation.abs may not shorten the distanceabs system will have the effect of  increased stopping distance due to  conditions such as gravel, pot holes,  slippery surfaces, wet road, ground  covered with snow etc.abs system will have the effect oftravelling on bad road, panic brak­ ing brake pedal may become hard,  this is due to abs system taking  control. abs will not compensate for  bad road, weather conditions and  poor driving judgment. always drivetravelling on bad road, panic brak­carefully in adverse weather and  traffic conditions.always keep safe distance and ad­ here to speed limits.

electronic brake force dis­ tribution (ebd)      ebd monitors and controls the  brake pressure on the rear  wheels to improve driving sta­ bility while braking.  ebd provides optimal braking pressure  distribution between front and rear wheels  to optimize braking distance and to ensure  vehicle stability by means of lowering  braking pressure increase at rear wheels.warningif ebd is malfunctioning, the rear  wheels can lock, e.g. under full  braking. this increases the risk of  skidding and an accident.if ebd is malfunctioning, the rearyou should therefore adapt your  driving style to the different handling  characteristics.  have the brake sys­ tem checked immediately at a tata  motors authorized service cen­ tre as soon as possible.you should therefore adapt yourelectronic  stability  pro­ gram (esp) (if equipped)electronic  stability  pro­esp monitors driving sta­ bility and traction.  if esp detects that the ve­ hicle is deviating from the direction desired  by the driver, one or more wheels are  braked to stabilize the vehicle. the engine  output is also modified to keep the vehicle  on the desired course within physical lim­ its. esp assists the driver when pulling  away on wet or slippery roads. esp can  also stabilize the vehicle during braking  and acceleration.additional safety features  (as available)  cornering stability control (csc)  corner stability control supports / stabi­ lizes vehicle during partial braking on  curves by reducing pressure at required  inner wheel of the vehicle.  this helps to reduce probability of vehicle  over steering during cornering.  off road abs  based on wheel speed information off  road abs helps to avoid wheel lock on un­ even surfaces like loose gravel, pot holes  by reducing the stopping distance com­ pared to standard abs.  electronic traction control (etc)  the electronic traction control system  function (etc) is designed as a slip control  system to prevent the driven wheels of a  vehicle from excessive wheel slip.  roll over mitigation (rom)  the main feature of the roll over mitiga­ tion function is the detection of a rollover  critical situation and to prevent the vehicle

rollover. this is done by active brake inter­ ventions on selected wheels, thereby re­ ducing the forces that cause a roll-over  situation.  brake disc wiping (bdw)  water on the brake disc leads to a delay  in brake response time. the purpose of  the function brake disc wiping is to re­ move moisture when driving in wet condi­ tions automatically. to get quick response  form brake and better deceleration.  electronic brake pre-fill (ebp)  the electronic brake prefill (ebp) function  reduces the air gap of the brake pad and  the brake disc. the function is triggered  after a sudden release of the accelerator  pedal due to an unexpected emergency  brake situation. by actively pre-filling the  brake-system the brake response time is  reduced and results in a shorter stopping  distance.  hydraulic brake assist (hba)in a dangerous emergency situation, most  drivers don’t use the full available perform­ ance of the brake system, because theybrake too soft. the hba function detects  the critical situation and builds up addi­ tional brake pressure to reduce the brak­ ing distance.  hydraulic  fading  compensation  (hfc)brake too soft. the hba function detects  the critical situation and builds up addi­ tional brake pressure to reduce the brak­ ing distance.  hydraulic  fading  compensationin dangerous fading situations most driv­ ers operate the brake pedal with a small  or regular braking force and they never  reach to the maximum possible vehicle de­ celeration. the hfc function improve the  stopping distance by eliminating required  pressure build-up lag by the driver.  dynamic wheel torque by brake  (dwt-b)  the main goal of the function is to improve  the agility of a vehicle and to enable a  more direct steering. this is mainly  achieved by braking interventions at the  inner wheels during turning. dwt-b re­ duces understeer tendency of the car and  a higher curve speed can be achieved.engine drag torque control (edtc)  on slippery road conditions during in- gear  braking or shift down of gear or sudden  throttle release on a curve road.  this causes high engine drag on the  driven wheel resulting into brake slip situ­ ations without any brake application.  this makes vehicle highly under steerable.  edtc controls such brake slip on the  driven wheels by increasing the engine  torque to makes the vehicle stable and  steerable.  hill hold control (hhc)  hill hold control is a comfort function. the  main intend is to prevent the vehicle from  rolling backwards while driving off up-hill  on an inclined surface.

driving tips  fuel consumption, engine, transmission,  brake and tyre wear are mainly affected by  the below factors:  operating conditions of your vehicle  • your personal driving style  • operating conditionsavoid frequent starts and stops as  these actions increase the fuel con­ sumption of the vehicle.  always ensure correct tyre pressure.  do not carry any unnecessary weight.regularly service your vehicle and ad­ • here to the recommended service  maintenance schedule.  personal driving styledo not press the accelerator pedal  when starting the engine.do not warm up the engine when the  vehicle is stationary.always adapt your driving style to suit  the prevailing road, weather condi­ tions, and maintain a safe dis-tance  from the vehicle in front. drive care­fully.avoid frequent, sudden acceleration  and braking.select appropriate gear according to  varying speeds and load conditions.notedo not rest your foot on the clutch pedal  while driving.switch ‘off’ the engine in stationary  traffic or at signals.keep an eye on the vehicle’s fuel con­ sumption.safety systems are merely aids de­ signed to assist driving. you are re­ sponsible for the distance between the  vehicles in front, for vehicle speed and  anticipating braking in good time.warningyou could lose control of your vehi­ cle if you try to adjust the driver’s  seat, head restraint, mirror, steering  wheel and fasten the seat belt whileyou could lose control of your vehi­driving. there is a risk of an acci­ dent.do not rest your hand on the shift  lever during driving; pressure trans­ mitted from your hand may result in  premature wear of the transaxle in­ ternal gear shift mechanism.press the clutch fully while shifting  the gears. the reverse gear should  be engaged only when the vehicle  is stationary. transmission may get  damage by trying to shift into re­ verse gear while the vehicle is mov­ ing. wait for 5 seconds after  declutching to ensure smooth en­ gagement of the reverse gear or  shift into one of the forward gears  for a moment while clutch is pressed  fully. this will avoid grinding of re­ verse gear while shifting.

driving  climbing sharp gradients on loose  surfaces  start off smoothly in a suitable gear. accel­ erate smoothly so that there is no loss of  traction by over-revving of the engine.  choose a smooth slope and select the ap­ propriate gear so that gear changing in the  middle of the climb is not required.  changing gears in the middle of the climb  can cause loss of momentum and engine  stalling. shifting to lower gear has to be  done cautiously to avoid loss of traction.under no conditions should the vehicle be  moved diagonally across a hill. the dan­ ger is in loss of traction and sideways slip­ page, possibly resulting in toppling over. if  unavoidable, choose a mild angle and  keep the vehicle moving.  if the tyres start to slip within few feet at  the end of the climb, keep the vehicle sta­ ble by steering left and right. it gives in­ creased grip to the tyres.    if the vehicle stalls or losses headway  while climbing a steep hill, make a quick  shift to reverse and allow the vehicle to  move back with the help of engine brak­ ing.descending sharp gradients  depending on the severity of the gradient,  shift into appropriate gear. use engine  braking judiciously without over-revving  the engine.  brake gently in such situations.warningwhen descending on sharp gradients,  do not turn the ignition key to the ‘off’  position. the braking assist and steer­ ing assist may malfunction and the  emission control system may be dam­ aged.braking  your vehicle has vacuum assisted brakes.  the distance needed to bring the vehicle  to a halt increases with the speed of the  vehicle. start applying brake anticipating  the distance and slow down gradually.warningdo not use the brake pedal as a  footrest.do not use the brake pedal as a

driving through water  do not drive through flooded areas. judge  the depth of water before driving through  it. otherwise, water may enter the vehicle  interior or the engine compartment.  if at all the situation demands that you  have to drive through water then;keep engine in higher rpm and crawl  the vehicle in low gear.flowing or rushing water creates  strong forces. driving through flowing  water could cause the vehicle to about  trying to drive through flowing water.lightly apply the brake pedal to dry the  liners until the brakes work normally  once you are out of water.warningdo not attempt to start the engine if ve­ hicle gets flooded due to water. tow the  vehicle to a safe place. contact a near­ est tata motors authorised service  centre.driving on a rainy daycheck wiper blades, lights and brakes  for proper functioning and condition.check the tyre treads depth, the con­ dition of the tread and tyre.avoid harsh braking and sharp turns. it  may cause loss of control and lead to  a skid.for slowing down, shift to lower gears  • and brake gently.  keep lights ‘on’ if visibility is poor  • driving on wet roads   on wet road or during light showers,  “aquaplaning” can occur. “aquaplaning” is  the loss of direct contact be-tween the  road surface and the vehicle’s tires due to  a water film forming between them. steer­ ing or braking the vehicle can be very dif­ ficult, and loss of control can occur.   there is no hard and fast rule about aqua­ planing. the best advice is to slow down  when the road is wet.noteif you have driven for a long time in  heavy rain without braking, there may  be a delayed reaction from the brakes  when braking for the first time. you have  to press the brake pedal more firmly.  maintain a greater distance from the ve­ hicle in frontnight drivingensure that all lights are working and  windshield, window glasses are clean.drive more slowly at night than in the  daytime, as the visual range is re­ stricted at night. maintain a speed such  that you can stop within illuminated  distance of headlamps.do not use the high beam unless in­ evitable. it may dazzle the driver of the  oncoming vehicle, thus causing an ac­ cident.use headlamp main/dip beam to alert  other road users on turns/ cross roads  etc.  use side indicators for lane change or

turning  driving on gradients  when climbing gradient, the vehicle may  begin to slow down and show a lack of  power. if this happens, shift to a lower gear  and apply power smoothly so that there is  no loss of traction.  when driving down a hill, the engine brak­ ing should be used by shifting into a lower  gear. do not drive in neutral gear or switch  off the engine.warningon long and steep gradients you must  reduce the load on the brakes by shift­ ing early to a lower gear. this allows  you to take ad-vantage of the engine  braking effect and helps avoid over­ heating of service brakes resulting in re­ duced braking efficiencydriving on highway   stopping distance progressively, in- creases with vehicle speed. maintain a  sufficient distance between your vehicle  and the vehicle ahead.   for long distance driving, perform safety  checks before starting a trip and take rest  at certain intervals to prevent fatigueseat belts  this section of user manual describes  your vehicle’s seat belt, airbag and child  restraints system. please read and follow  all these instructions care-fully to minimise  risk of severe injury or death.seat belts are the primary restraints  system in the vehicle. all occupants,  including the driver, should always  wear their seat belts to minimize the  risk of injury.sit back and adjust (if equipped), the  • seat. make sure that your seat is ad­ justed to a good driving position and  the back of the seat is upright.  buckling the shoulder seat beltgrasp the tongue then slowly pull out  the seat belt over the shoulder and  across the chest. when the seat belt is  long enough to fit, insert the tongue  into the lock buckle until you hear a  “click” which indicates that the seat  belt is securely locked.position the lap portion of seat belt  across your pelvic bone, below your

anti-lock braking system  (abs) (if equipped)abs  regulates  brake  pressure in such a way  that the wheels do not  lock when you brake.  this allows you to continue steering the  vehicle when braking.  the abs warning lamp in the instrument  cluster lights up when the ignition is  switched on. it goes off after 2-3 seconds  if system is healthy.warningif abs is faulty, the wheels could  lock when braking. the steer ability  and braking characteristics may be  severely impaired. there is an in­ creased danger of skidding and ac­ cidents.if abs is faulty, the wheels coulddrive on carefully. have abs  checked immediately at the tata  motors authorized service cen­ tre as soon as possible.drive on carefully. have abswhile brakingin case of emergency braking, press  the brake pedal fully. this allows the  abs to regulate braking force and  maintain directional control of vehicle.when abs is active driver may feel  brake pedal pulsating and very low  (abs) motor activation noise from en­ gine compartment which is normal dur­ ing braking.warningabs may not shorten the distance  in all situation.abs may not shorten the distanceabs system will have the effect of  increased stopping distance due to  conditions such as gravel, pot holes,  slippery surfaces, wet road, ground  covered with snow etc.abs system will have the effect oftravelling on bad road, panic brak­ ing brake pedal may become hard,  this is due to abs system taking  control. abs will not compensate for  bad road, weather conditions and  poor driving judgment. always drivetravelling on bad road, panic brak­carefully in adverse weather and  traffic conditions.always keep safe distance and ad­ here to speed limits.

electronic brake force dis­ tribution (ebd)      ebd monitors and controls the  brake pressure on the rear  wheels to improve driving sta­ bility while braking.  ebd provides optimal braking pressure  distribution between front and rear wheels  to optimize braking distance and to ensure  vehicle stability by means of lowering  braking pressure increase at rear wheels.warningif ebd is malfunctioning, the rear  wheels can lock, e.g. under full  braking. this increases the risk of  skidding and an accident.if ebd is malfunctioning, the rearyou should therefore adapt your  driving style to the different handling  characteristics.  have the brake sys­ tem checked immediately at a tata  motors authorized service cen­ tre as soon as possible.you should therefore adapt yourelectronic  stability  pro­ gram (esp) (if equipped)electronic  stability  pro­esp monitors driving sta­ bility and traction.  if esp detects that the ve­ hicle is deviating from the direction desired  by the driver, one or more wheels are  braked to stabilize the vehicle. the engine  output is also modified to keep the vehicle  on the desired course within physical lim­ its. esp assists the driver when pulling  away on wet or slippery roads. esp can  also stabilize the vehicle during braking  and acceleration.additional safety features  (as available)  cornering stability control (csc)  corner stability control supports / stabi­ lizes vehicle during partial braking on  curves by reducing pressure at required  inner wheel of the vehicle.  this helps to reduce probability of vehicle  over steering during cornering.  off road abs  based on wheel speed information off  road abs helps to avoid wheel lock on un­ even surfaces like loose gravel, pot holes  by reducing the stopping distance com­ pared to standard abs.  electronic traction control (etc)  the electronic traction control system  function (etc) is designed as a slip control  system to prevent the driven wheels of a  vehicle from excessive wheel slip.  roll over mitigation (rom)  the main feature of the roll over mitiga­ tion function is the detection of a rollover  critical situation and to prevent the vehicle

rollover. this is done by active brake inter­ ventions on selected wheels, thereby re­ ducing the forces that cause a roll-over  situation.  brake disc wiping (bdw)  water on the brake disc leads to a delay  in brake response time. the purpose of  the function brake disc wiping is to re­ move moisture when driving in wet condi­ tions automatically. to get quick response  form brake and better deceleration.  electronic brake pre-fill (ebp)  the electronic brake prefill (ebp) function  reduces the air gap of the brake pad and  the brake disc. the function is triggered  after a sudden release of the accelerator  pedal due to an unexpected emergency  brake situation. by actively pre-filling the  brake-system the brake response time is  reduced and results in a shorter stopping  distance.  hydraulic brake assist (hba)in a dangerous emergency situation, most  drivers don’t use the full available perform­ ance of the brake system, because theybrake too soft. the hba function detects  the critical situation and builds up addi­ tional brake pressure to reduce the brak­ ing distance.  hydraulic  fading  compensation  (hfc)brake too soft. the hba function detects  the critical situation and builds up addi­ tional brake pressure to reduce the brak­ ing distance.  hydraulic  fading  compensationin dangerous fading situations most driv­ ers operate the brake pedal with a small  or regular braking force and they never  reach to the maximum possible vehicle de­ celeration. the hfc function improve the  stopping distance by eliminating required  pressure build-up lag by the driver.  dynamic wheel torque by brake  (dwt-b)  the main goal of the function is to improve  the agility of a vehicle and to enable a  more direct steering. this is mainly  achieved by braking interventions at the  inner wheels during turning. dwt-b re­ duces understeer tendency of the car and  a higher curve speed can be achieved.engine drag torque control (edtc)  on slippery road conditions during in- gear  braking or shift down of gear or sudden  throttle release on a curve road.  this causes high engine drag on the  driven wheel resulting into brake slip situ­ ations without any brake application.  this makes vehicle highly under steerable.  edtc controls such brake slip on the  driven wheels by increasing the engine  torque to makes the vehicle stable and  steerable.  hill hold control (hhc)  hill hold control is a comfort function. the  main intend is to prevent the vehicle from  rolling backwards while driving off up-hill  on an inclined surface.

driving tips  fuel consumption, engine, transmission,  brake and tyre wear are mainly affected by  the below factors:  operating conditions of your vehicle  • your personal driving style  • operating conditionsavoid frequent starts and stops as  these actions increase the fuel con­ sumption of the vehicle.  always ensure correct tyre pressure.  do not carry any unnecessary weight.regularly service your vehicle and ad­ • here to the recommended service  maintenance schedule.  personal driving styledo not press the accelerator pedal  when starting the engine.do not warm up the engine when the  vehicle is stationary.always adapt your driving style to suit  the prevailing road, weather condi­ tions, and maintain a safe dis-tance  from the vehicle in front. drive care­fully.avoid frequent, sudden acceleration  and braking.select appropriate gear according to  varying speeds and load conditions.notedo not rest your foot on the clutch pedal  while driving.switch ‘off’ the engine in stationary  traffic or at signals.keep an eye on the vehicle’s fuel con­ sumption.safety systems are merely aids de­ signed to assist driving. you are re­ sponsible for the distance between the  vehicles in front, for vehicle speed and  anticipating braking in good time.warningyou could lose control of your vehi­ cle if you try to adjust the driver’s  seat, head restraint, mirror, steering  wheel and fasten the seat belt whileyou could lose control of your vehi­driving. there is a risk of an acci­ dent.do not rest your hand on the shift  lever during driving; pressure trans­ mitted from your hand may result in  premature wear of the transaxle in­ ternal gear shift mechanism.press the clutch fully while shifting  the gears. the reverse gear should  be engaged only when the vehicle  is stationary. transmission may get  damage by trying to shift into re­ verse gear while the vehicle is mov­ ing. wait for 5 seconds after  declutching to ensure smooth en­ gagement of the reverse gear or  shift into one of the forward gears  for a moment while clutch is pressed  fully. this will avoid grinding of re­ verse gear while shifting.

not in neutral or with clutch pedal  pressed.use the car ac only when you require.  for cooling, keep the blower speeds  low, as at higher blower speeds, the  ac consumes more electric power  which is ultimately drawn from engine  by burning fuel.avoid unnecessary extra electrical  loading on the car.stop the engine wisely at traffic sig­ nals. switch ‘off’ the engine at the  traffic signal only if the stoppage time  is high (typically more than  30 sec).when you drive on highways, close all  the windows. this reduces the drag on  the vehicle and improves fuel effi­ ciency.do not over speed. follow the speed  limits. with increasing speed, the en­ gine rpm increases to overcome exter­ nal air resistance and this reduces fuel  efficiency.running-in period  the purpose of running in a car is to give  time for the mechanical parts to settle so  that they work efficiently. this involves  gentle acceleration and not revving the en­ gine too much. this is done by changing  gears early for the first 1,500 – 1,800 km.  this will increase the life of the engine.  the more you look after the engine when  it is new, the more satisfied you will be with  its performance in the future.  do not exceed the following road speeds  during running in period.seat adjustments  front seat adjustments (option 1)  following seat adjustments can be carried  out manually.    backrest recliner adjustment lever  1.seat height adjustment lever (if avail­ 2. able)seat forward / rearward adjustment  3. lever
